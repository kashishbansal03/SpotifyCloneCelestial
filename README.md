Celestfy is a conceptual Spotify clone meticulously designed on Figma, seamlessly blending celestial aesthetics with cutting-edge user experience. This revolutionary interface aims to redefine how users engage with music, transforming their interaction into an ethereal journey through the cosmos.

# Design Principles:

### Cosmic Aesthetics: 
The interface draws inspiration from celestial bodies, featuring gradients that mimic the colors of distant galaxies, constellations, and shimmering stars. A dark mode option provides an immersive experience reminiscent of gazing at the night sky.

### Transcendent Navigation: 
The navigation system navigates like a constellation map. Users traverse playlists, artists, and albums along virtual star paths, creating an intuitive and interconnected browsing experience.

### Dynamic Constellations: 
Every playlist is represented by a unique constellation icon, forming an intuitive visual connection between music genres and celestial formations. Users can even customize their profile with a preferred constellation theme.
